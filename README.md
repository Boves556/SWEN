### EXERCISES:
  - [Rust](././rust_assignments.md)


## Class Design - Flipped Classroom

- 60-90min | Review and joint development of selected Homework Exercises
- 20-30min | Brief theoretical input on computational thinking with Algorithms and Data Structures.
- 60-90min | Practical Exercises and Coding Examples with Rust

## Deliverables (mandatory)

Each session below comes with a set of exercises. You are required to prepare these exercises before each class. I will provide feedback and guidance on the side. For each session, I will pick some difficult or important exercises and discuss solutions with the class. The exercises are plenty and you will hardly be able to complete all of them. Make sure to definitely work on all Exercises until Session 6.



## Preliminary Requirements before 1st Day of Class

- Walk through the rustlings tutorial: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
- Finish all [Exercises](././rust_assignments.md) for Session 1


## Exam (graded)

The Exam will be written and online. It will be a code exercise with tests provided.

## Sessions

### 1. Types: Rust Data Types and Tooling

Learning Goals:
- Understand why are types important for programming in General
- Understand how can types help support efficiency, safety, and security
- Know basic types in Rust and understand how they compare to Python
- Understand the differences between scalar types, compound types, and structs
- Apply Numeric Types, Strings, and Pointers in your programs.
- Apply Tuples, Arrays, Vectors, and Hashmaps in your programs.


### 2. Memory Management: Mutability and Ownership

Learning Goals:
- Understand head and stack and their usage and implications for structuring programs
- Understand the need for and pitfalls of pointers
- Understand the difference between mutable and immutable types
- Understand how C, Python and Rust handle memory
- Understand Ownership and Borrowing and Rust for both mutable and immutable types
- Analyse and resolve issues arising from Ownership and Borrowing in your own code
