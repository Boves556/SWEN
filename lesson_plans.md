# Lesson overview

## Lesson 1 - 20.03.2023

---

### Class Goals

- Learn clean coding in python
- Understand abstraction
- Find a direction for personal projects


### Class Implementation (LISTEN - REPEAT - UNDERSTAND)

- Lecture (Very Brief Theory and Showcasing)
- Practice (Interactive Hands-on Exercises)
- Exercises (Small coding challenges to implement concepts)

---

### Literature and Reading

- Literature provides and addon to the concepts discussed in class. Read when triggered by a lack of understanding or when trying to solve a specific problem.
- Focus is on Code Exercises

---

### What you need to know or repeat

1. Basics of Computer Architecture and Abstraction
2. You have setup and know how to use the command line interface on your machine (WSL2 for Windows)
3. You have an editor of choice installed and tweaked to your likings (VIM, VScode, PyCharm)
4. You understand the basics of Git and Github (Clone, Commit, Push, Pull Requests) as these are necessary to work on the exercises.
